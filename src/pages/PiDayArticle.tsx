      <h2>Generating Non-Singular Revenue from Staking Tokens</h2>
      <p>
        This helps us generate non-singular revenue from staking tokens in the AO ecosystem, and you can adjust your revenue ratio independently. 
        Similar to your daily portfolio allocation, this fully reflects the fairness of AO, fully respects users' own choices, and encourages projects under the AO ecosystem to follow this principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's very simple, you can <a href="https://ao.arweave.net/#/mint/yield/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjust your staking preferences here</a>. 
        After entering, you will see options like PI, AO, AR, APUS, BOTG, PIXL, ARIO, ACTION, PL, and others. You can select one or more tokens and adjust their proportions independently.
